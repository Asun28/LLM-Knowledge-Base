<!-- FORMAT GUIDE — read before adding items
Each phase section groups items by severity, then by module area.
Resolved phases collapse to a one-liner; active phases list every item.

## Severity Levels

| Level      | Meaning                                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| CRITICAL   | Data loss, crash with no recovery, or security exploit — blocks release |
| HIGH       | Silent wrong results, unhandled exceptions reaching users, reliability risk |
| MEDIUM     | Quality gaps, missing test coverage, misleading APIs, dead code |
| LOW        | Style, docs, naming, minor inconsistencies — fix opportunistically |

## Item Format

```
- `module/file.py` `function_or_symbol` — description of the issue
  (fix: suggested remedy if non-obvious)
```

Rules:
- Lead with the file path (relative to `src/kb/`), then the function/symbol.
- Include line numbers only when they add precision (e.g. `file.py:273`).
- End with `(fix: ...)` when the remedy is non-obvious or involves a design choice.
- One bullet = one issue. Don't combine unrelated problems.
- When resolving an item, delete it (don't strikethrough). Record the fix in CHANGELOG.md.
- Move resolved phases under "## Resolved Phases" with a one-line summary.
